# Overload Resolver Extension Point

The `overloadResolver` extension point in the IntelliJ Platform provides a mechanism for defining custom logic to compare and prioritize Groovy method overloads during method resolution.

## Definition

```xml
<extensionPoint name="overloadResolver" dynamic="true" interface="org.jetbrains.plugins.groovy.lang.resolve.api.GroovyOverloadResolver"/>
```

## Example Instances

Below are example implementations of the `overloadResolver` extension point:

```xml
<overloadResolver implementation="org.jetbrains.plugins.groovy.lang.resolve.DGMGetAtOverloadResolver" order="last"/>
<overloadResolver implementation="org.jetbrains.plugins.groovy.lang.resolve.impl.DistanceOverloadResolver" order="last"/>
```

## Key Method

Implementations of this extension point must provide the following method:

```java
int compare(@NotNull GroovyMethodResult left, @NotNull GroovyMethodResult right);
```

### Return Value:
- **Negative Value**: Indicates that `left` is more preferable.
- **Zero**: Indicates that neither `left` nor `right` is preferable.
- **Positive Value**: Indicates that `right` is more preferable.

## Purpose of the Extension

The `overloadResolver` extension point is used to refine or override the default logic for resolving and prioritizing Groovy method overloads. This ensures that the IDEâ€™s behavior aligns with specific language rules or provides additional flexibility for custom Groovy dialects.

It plays a key role in:
- **Resolving ambiguities** when multiple method overloads match a call.
- **Ensuring consistency** with Groovy compiler rules or custom language extensions.

## Built-in Implementations

### `org.jetbrains.plugins.groovy.lang.resolve.DGMGetAtOverloadResolver`
This implementation lowers the priority of specific `DefaultGroovyMethods` overloads:
- `DefaultGroovyMethods.getAt(Object, String)`
- `DefaultGroovyMethods.putAt(Object, String, Object)`

#### Purpose:
Groovy tends to prioritize `DGM#getAt(Object, String)` over `DGM#getAt(Map, Object)` due to argument distance, despite the latter being more specific and better aligned with generic types. This implementation:
- Artificially lowers the priority of `Object`-based overloads in favor of `Map`-based ones to ensure better generic handling.
- Applies similar logic to `putAt` overloads.

#### Method Highlights:
- **Extension Method Handling**: Considers whether the method is an extension method and resolves it accordingly.
- **Parameter Matching**: Identifies and deprioritizes methods that use overly generic parameter types (`Object`) compared to more specific overloads.

### `org.jetbrains.plugins.groovy.lang.resolve.impl.DistanceOverloadResolver`
This implementation compares overloads based on the **argument-to-parameter mapping distance**.

#### Purpose:
When multiple methods are applicable, this resolver:
- Prefers methods with closer argument-to-parameter matches.
- Ensures that the method with the most specific mapping is selected.

#### Method Highlights:
- **Mapping Comparison**: Evaluates the quality of the argument mapping for both `left` and `right` methods.
- **Null Mapping Handling**: Handles cases where one or both methods lack a valid argument mapping, ensuring a consistent resolution outcome.

## How it Works

The `overloadResolver` extension point integrates into the Groovy method resolution process in IntelliJ IDEA. It affects:
- **Code Completion**: By influencing the priority of overloads suggested in autocompletion.
- **Type Inference**: By helping select the most appropriate method overload based on context.
- **Error Highlighting**: By ensuring that ambiguous or incorrect overload selections are flagged appropriately.

## Implementation Guidelines

To implement a custom `overloadResolver`:
1. Extend the `org.jetbrains.plugins.groovy.lang.resolve.api.GroovyOverloadResolver` interface.
2. Provide custom logic in the `compare` method to evaluate and prioritize method overloads.
3. Register your implementation in the plugin's `plugin.xml` file.

Example:

```xml
<overloadResolver implementation="com.example.MyCustomOverloadResolver" order="before default"/>
```

This extension point enables fine-grained control over how IntelliJ IDEA resolves and prioritizes Groovy method overloads, ensuring alignment with specific rules or use cases.
